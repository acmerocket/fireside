About
-----

The Z-machine Preservation Project is an attempt to capture and document the
Z-machine's architecture and design principles and to provide a modern Java
implementation that can be easily maintained and extended. Its goal is to be a reference
Java implementation of the Z-machine specification.

Features:

- written from scratch using Java 5
- currently supports story file version 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7 and 8
- can be run as a Java applet within the web browser
- saves and reads games in Quetzal 1.4 format
- reads media in Blorb 1.1 format
- input stream 0 and 1 (keyboard, mouse and file)
- output streams 1, 2 and 3 (screen, transcript, memory with nesting)
- split subwindows (paging, buffering, scrolling)
- multiple font styles and colors (console Frotz color scheme)
- sound effects (AIFF)
- accented characters and unicode
- timed input, preinitialized input
- game-defined dictionaries, alphabet tables and accent tables
- undo

Running as an application
-------------------------

Command line:

java -jar zmpp.jar

On most systems, double clicking on the application jar file should start
the software as well.

Select a game

Reading Blorb files
---------------------

Blorb files must have the same filename as their story files, with a suffix of ".blb". The
name is case-sensitive, so the name should be exactly the same way as the respective
story file

Running as an applet
--------------------

applet parameters:

storyfile - the URL of the story file, must be on the same server as the jar file
blorbfile - the URL of the blorb file, must be on the same server as the jar file


Operating systems tested on:
-------------------------

- Linux
- Windows XP
- Mac OS X
