About
-----

The Z-machine Preservation Project is an attempt to capture and document the
Z-machine's architecture and design principles and to provide a modern Java
implementation that can be easily maintained and extended.

For remarks and suggestions for improvements, please contact
me using the ZMPP project homepage:

the software as well.
