The Z-machine Preservation Project is an attempt to capture and document the
Z-machine's architecture and design principles and to provide a modern Java
implementation that can be easily maintained and extended.

Features:

- Written from scratch using Java 5
- Currently supports story file version 3
- Save and reads games in Quetzal 1.4 format
- Supports input stream 0 and 1 (keyboard and file)

For remarks and suggestions for improvements, please contact
me using the ZMPP project homepage:
