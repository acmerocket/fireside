About
-----

The Z-machine Preservation Project is an attempt to capture and document the
Z-machine's architecture and design principles and to provide a modern Java
implementation that can be easily maintained and extended. Its goal is to be a reference
Java implementation of the Z-machine specification.

Features:

- written from scratch using Java 5
- currently supports story file version 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7 and 8
- can be run as a Java applet within the web browser
- saves and reads games in Quetzal 1.4 format
- reads media in Blorb format
- reads Z code embedded in Blorb files
- shows Inform 7 meta data in application mode
- input stream 0 and 1 (keyboard, mouse and file)
- output streams 1, 2 and 3 (screen, transcript, memory with nesting)
- split subwindows (paging, buffering, scrolling)
- multiple font styles and colors (console Frotz color scheme)
- sound effects (AIFF)
- accented characters and unicode
- timed input, preinitialized input
- game-defined dictionaries, alphabet tables and accent tables
- command history
- multiple undo

For remarks and suggestions for improvements, please contact
me using the ZMPP project homepage:

TODO:

- character graphics
- save/restore regions
- version 6

**************************************
Running as an application
*************************************

Command line:

java -jar zmpp.jar [story-file]

On most systems, double clicking on the application jar file should start
the software as well.

Select a game:

The game can be specified on the command line, if there is no story file
specified, the application comes up with a file dialog

Reading Blorb files
---------------------

Blorb files must have the same filename as their story files, with a suffix of ".blb". The
name is case-sensitive, so the name should be exactly the same way as the respective
story file.
Note: ZMPP can handle Blorb-wrapped story files which are recognized by
having either a ".zblb" or ".zblorb" extension.

**************************
Running as an applet
**************************

applet parameters:

1. storyfile:
-------------
the URL of the story file, must be on the same server as the jar file

2. blorbfile (optional):
------------------------
the URL of the blorb file, must be on the same server as the jar file

3. saveto (optional):
---------------------
if set to "file", the applet will try to save a game state to the
user's file system, the default value is "memory" which saves a game
within the Java VM's memory


Note: if only the blorbfile parameter is specified, the interpreter assumes
that the story is embedded in the blorb file


Operating systems tested on:
-------------------------

- Linux
- Windows XP
- Mac OS X
