About
-----

The Z-machine Preservation Project is an attempt to capture and document the
Z-machine's architecture and design principles and to provide a modern Java
implementation that can be easily maintained and extended. Its goal is to be the reference
Java implemetation of the Z-machine specification.

Features:

- written from scratch using Java 5
- probably the cleanest, fastest and most complete Java implementation of the Z-machine
   specification to date
- currently supports story file version 3, 4, 5, 7 and 8
- can be run as a Java applet within the web browser
- saves and reads games in Quetzal 1.4 format
- input stream 0 and 1 (keyboard and file)
- output streams 1, 2 and 3 (screen, transcript, memory with nesting)
- split subwindows (paging, buffering, scrolling)
- multiple font styles and colors
- timed input, preinitialized input
- undo
