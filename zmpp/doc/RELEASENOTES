About
-----

The Z-machine Preservation Project is an attempt to capture and document the
Z-machine's architecture and design principles and to provide a modern Java
implementation that can be easily maintained and extended.

Features:

- Written from scratch using Java 5
- Currently supports story file version 3
- Save and reads games in Quetzal 1.4 format
- Supports input stream 0 and 1 (keyboard and file)
- Supports output streams 1 and 2 (screen and transcript)

For remarks and suggestions for improvements, please contact
me using the ZMPP project homepage:

http://sourceforge.net/projects/zmpp

TODO:

Streams

- change streams to handle Z-characters only, one by one
- handle z characters instead of strings in output streams, currently normal strings
- echo input to activated streams, is currently directly painted on the screen for keyboard input

Screen model

- implement paging in screen model
- implement non-word-wrapping scheme (continue on next line)
- implement split_screen, split_window

Running
-------

Command line:

java -jar zmpp.jar

On most systems, double clicking on the application jar file should start
the software as well.
